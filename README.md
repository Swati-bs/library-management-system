# library-management-system
 A library system lets users manage books. The Book class has private variables for title, author, serial number, and availability, with public functions to set and get these values. borrowBook &amp; returnBook are used to display the availability of books. The library uses a dynamic array for up to 100 books, validating user input to manage actions.
